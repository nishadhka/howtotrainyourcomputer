By all means today's computers are the most powerful computing tool ever made. 
This workshop tries to show a set of tools and exercises to train that dragon!. Which may 
enhance its apprenticeship in scientific work, challenging both in terms of computing and 
data scale, such as in Conservation Sciences. Scientific presentation style used by Galileo Galilei, 
time travelling with lifeboats are some of the tools and exercise going to be used for the training
while we interact with computers in Python!.

Python programming language is an easy to read and learn computing language. 
Its open source nature and wide usage gives rise to strong base of libraries 
and tools to address any complex and data intensive real world problems. 
Open source python distribution such as Anaconda simplifies creation of working environment. 
Tools like Jupyter notebook enhance the work flow which is intuitive, easy to share and 
collectively learn faster on data analysis using Python. This workshop intent to give 
introduction to these advantages of Python along with operating system virtualization and 
version controlling system for programming. It takes demonstration and do it yourself tasks 
on geospatial data, the workshop hopes to generate interest and show learning pathway for 
student to become comfortable with Python programming language.

Rather than a linear approach, the workshop will be comprised of a set of micro projects
covering the concepts and technologies of the workshop theme. Participants are requested to 
check this space at the nearest days of workshop.
