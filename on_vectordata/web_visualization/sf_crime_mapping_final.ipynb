    "\n",
    "In this post, I demonstrate the use of the Python package Folium to create a web map from a GeoDataFrame. Folium is built on the Leaflet javascript library, which is a great tool for creating interactive web maps. However, I use Python for all of my data wrangling and analytical tasks, so it's really nice to be able to have the web-mapping capabilities from within the same environment. The goal of this post is to demonstrate a workflow between GeoPandas and Folium that makes it really easy to create functional and visually appealing web maps in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, I plot the point locations of crimes in San Francisco, overlaid on a choropleth of census tract crime density. Viewing these two layers together on a web map creates a nice way to get an overall sense of crime distribution, while also being able to view individual crime information. As I demonstrate below, these Python packages provide a nice, clean, and customizable way of doing this."

I write a separate function to plot each of these two layers, each of which takes a GeoDataFrame as its input. Folium takes unprojected lat/long coordinates for all of its plotting, so I make sure to convert all of my projected GeoDataFrames to WGS84 within the plotting functions.\n",

GeoPandas has a ```to_json``` method which I use to convert the GeoDataFrame to GeoJSON to be used as one of the inputs to Folium's choropleth function. I also specify the id field, which is used to link the geometry in the GeoJSON with the data in the GeoDataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function also takes optional parameters for fill color, fill opacity, line opacity, number of classifiers, and classification scheme. All of these have default values if not specified. Folium / Leaflet uses the [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=YlOrRd&n=5) sequential color schemes, which can easily be specified to view different combinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I allow the user to specify the number of classes and the classification scheme. At this point, Folium has limited map classification options, so I instead use Pysal's choropleth [map classfication module](http://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/library/esda/mapclassify.html) to provide some basic classification options.

I use this feature only in the most basic form, just to display a few lines of information: crime description, date, time, and address.
